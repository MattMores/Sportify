# Welcome to Sportify!

## About
Sportify is a full-stack web application serving you a weekly mixtape of fresh bets. Users can create, post and update bets that they're thinking of making - allowing their friends to review, rate and comment with their own thoughts. The goal is to build a community of bettors who can share their insights and thoughts on individual bets so that, collectively, everyone can make smarter betting decisions.
